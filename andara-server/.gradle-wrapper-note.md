# Gradle Wrapper Note

The Gradle wrapper jar (`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`) is required for the build to work.

If it's missing, you can download it by running:
```bash
./gradlew wrapper
```

Or if you have Gradle installed:
```bash
gradle wrapper
```

The Makefile will attempt to download it automatically if missing, but requires either:
- The `gradlew` script to be able to download it (requires network access)
- Or a system Gradle installation
